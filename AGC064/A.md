Wow, 6 months ago I had some [incredible recursive construction](https://atcoder.jp/contests/agc064/submissions/54886331) which makes a lot of sense.

If you just write it out in triangle order though...

```
1234567
 234567
  34567
   4567
    567
     67
      7
```

ideas and answers become pretty obvious. 

Though I only did this because of [this jdurie problem](https://codeforces.com/gym/102431/problem/I). 

Kind of crazy how thought works.
