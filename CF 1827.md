A casual CP evening :)

# A

Sort b, and then just do the combo :/ observation is both greedy + combo 
# B1

If you sort two intervals [a, b], [b + 1, d]... it's not always better to just combine them, rip. 

But one thing is for sure: If I want to get 1 to the starting position, it's pretty much always better to do [1...pos[1]], right? 

Well, what if 2 is right after that, you don't want to repeat that work. I guess if intervals touch then you want to merge. 

So my proposal is to first, just do the naive [i...pos[i]] algorithm, and then merge all intervals generated from that process. That is your answer.

---

Okay, I came up with a stack solution of thinking about them like merging intervals of values, not ranges, but wtf was that lmao, so weird. I feel like I just pattern matched that from memory, some distinct memory of me reading the editorial for that surfaced. Hm. At least I can redeirve it I guess?

---

Just looked at my old approach That DP is some gigantic brain shit, what the fuck was me from a year ago cooking. 

But yeah, I remember literally looking at edi solution and implementing the stack solution straight up. And I'm pretty sure I remember B2 being optimized stack and I'm like, "fuckkk I gotta learn this?" Welp guess I do.

---
# B2 

Wait no, I wasn't going crazy, it's the # of prefix maxes < suffix mins. I'm not going crazy. Same observation as 1270H.

The only issue is that's like not possible to optimize for this problem. Think of something a bit better? Maybe modify the stack solution :yuck:

Okay, we analyze the contribution for just one pair (i, i + 1).

Uh, you get a list of potential prefix maxes and suffix mins, and it's just impossible to reason about them. Doesn't seem like there's a faster than O(n) way to analyze the cut. 

---
# C

An even palindrome can always be treated as a bracket sequence breakup, so all even palindromes can be treated as this bracket sequence thing. 

However, there's 26 distinct "brackets" sooo.....

Well, there's a greedy way to check if a string works lol. Wait wasn't this in like ocpc? 

Ahh, never mind. Okay that doesn't work, I'm stupid. Counter:

```
a yy zz a
```
you can delete this evenly, but you can't decompose into even palindromes. So even palindromes, unsurprisingly, are **stronger**. 

Wait; okay. 

Suppose we had something like 
```
[even length palin, start end w/ A][bullshit][even length palin, start end w/ A]
```

We can strip off the leading characters and ending characters and it still works. 

If they're not the same, then there must be a split somewhere. 

Okay, maybe we can refactor the blift approach to just find the closest even length palindrome that works. 

Uh I don't think that works for this problem... wtf I just need to find a better condition for even length palin. 

Even length palindrome can always be treated as a bracket sequence breakup 

However, a bracket sequence breakup can fail the even palindrome check :/ 

So maybe we can somehow subtract the overcounting. 

---
Okay so the process is, a bracket deletion such that **you only can go up if your previous move was an up, or you were previously at zero**. 

Perhaps there's something special about how you decompose even length candidates; I already found a nice property for when the first and last character are the same, that if it were truly a beautiful substring, you can just delete the first and last character.

=> That works with any palindrome decomposition, actually... well I guess "odd palindrome" would always fucking work lmao. 

Otherwise, you need to just check every possible break :/ 

- That's not even true. Again, 
```
a xx yy a 
```

fucking breaks the example. I understand the logic if the palindrome NEEDED two decompositions, but in the case of 1 decomp, it's just not true. 

FUCKKK

Literally no observations on this problem

---
Okay, how about the set of possible decompositions. Is something like this possible??

(...palin...)(palin)
(palin)(...palin...)  

well (4)(6) (6)(4) makes everything equal

(4)(12)
(12)(4)

Okay it feels pretty legit that if that were true, then everything is the same character.

Therefore, the decompositions must look like 


(unique palindrome)(unique palindrome)(unique palindrome)

Wait no that's not true 

(abba)(abba)
(abbaabba)
???

Well okay fine wow nice counterexample, there's two components here. 

xxabbayy

xxabbaxx

# Post Mortem KMS 

Alright, for C, I can claim that "oh I could've just guessed that" and sure, but I was trying to work out how overlapping palindromes work and if you can just take the min one, and I could not. So this is string skill issue

**FUCKING B2??? HELLO??? I CAME UP WITH THE EXACT CONDITION.**

But these monotonic problems are so gigantic brain. This reminds me of [1887D Split](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1887/D)

For C, it reminded me of how I need to get better at string trickery; there was this one problem G with string bounds 1e7 that required that. This isn't like a know z-function or know manachers skill issue (though that should def be fixed...), this is literally just a reasoning issue. 

---
# D

Okay, you have to have an even number of nodes.

To have two centroids is to have a subtree of size n/2, this is an iff. 

Okay, it's defined for any rooted tree, so what's wrong with just storing the set of subtree sizes and then doing a lowerbound query.

Ahh.... you need to update a subset of guys, an ancestor chain. Spooky! 

Also, this obviously isn't sufficient; you need to do casework 

(x, n) => how many updates until 2 * (x + v) = (n + v) 

which is just v = n - 2 * x

Ah, okay, so you still just want the highest subtree size <= n/2, so that's nice to know.  Actually that was kinda obvious from my greedy argument.. anyways.

---
Well, if we JUST wanted the max, we could do an range update, then only go up the ancestor so much s.t. you're in range of <= n/2. 

The issue is that N is constnatly chanigng... so a value might go offline/online at some point regardless.

how tf to do this 

Okay, so what if we just maintained the actual centroid online, then found the max subtree size hanging off of that. We can do this with a random sample, followed by a log(n) euler tour check, for a total of N x R x log(N) time complexity. Which admittedly isnt going to pass anyways... but then we have the issue of maintaining the max subtree size anyways rip. 

---
Well, you can try doing this. 

Maintain a set of "too big" nodes and not too big nodes. Notice these are monotonic to the root. (if I'm too big, all my ancestors are too big.)

Every time you update a subtree size, maybe at most only a few nodes can change. 



Well, effectively ever step, the threshhold goes up by 0.5, while a node and all its ancestors go up by 1. 

if a node X goes from good to bad, can its child? i dont think so since its child has strictly less nodes, but you just crossed the threshhold by only 1. 

but i guess the worry is, can you construct some degen case 

```
 x
 |
 |
[big degree]
etc. 
```

No, I feel like most of them will shrink to zero; you have to be "focused" to keep them all up but it's impossible to keep them all up. I have no idea how to really prove this. 

Okay, assuming this was the intended solution, how do I even implement this. 

The set of "too big" nodes form a rooted tree up top, with its leaves exposed; we will target the leaves. 

After every update: 

- We added a leaf to the real tree. Go up the tree as far as possible, until you reach an unmarked node; if that is bad, add it to the bad set. Otherwise just update the parent leaf node accordingly.
- Assume we have a perfectly accurate representation for all colored leaf nodes. Then it's tirvial to just query the min colored leaf node, and then we can re-add its parent if it gets stale in the queue. 

Wait this is bad, because we're only keeping track of bad nodes. We can't extract information from good nodes like this. 

---

The observation here is that, okay, when we update every value on a chain, for that chain, only a select few change, and then also everybody else contracts. 

Imagine if it was just a big long-legs star graph, with 1 as the center. 

---

What the fuck am I talking about? The colored tree doesn't form an arbitrary spider-like graph at the top. 

It's literally just a straight line. Lol. Holy shit. 

And the answer to the problem is the max of everybody not on that dynamically maintained path, which you can easily check by either checking the head's current size, or by doing a random sample, no? This is just a way simpler way of my dynamic centroid maintaining...

Okay, "max of everybody not on my path" is a log(n) query by that one problem. But this randomized algorithm feels like it's gonna TLE....

Also... eh the randomized algorihtm definitely works if you implement it carefully, its just gonna like literally TLE though....

Well, you also have to do range path add queries, which is log^2. But the "max of everybody not on my path" can be done fast to avoid the random algorithm; just return the proper tin value and you're on your merry way. 

---
Argh, I'm so close yet so far. 

Right now I need range update, range query which is impossible without hld. 

Is it possible I simply point update? **I think it is.** 

The only thing that matters is simply the path that you take down from the root down to the leaf; that "balance" between the colored and uncolored is O(1) nodes to keep track of. 

---
Okay, but like, Interactive Mex Tree was a 3500, and Two Centroids is a 3000. 

Surely, they don't use the literal same observation, let me think some more, but otherwise that's a log(n) solution. 

Nah that's a log(n) solution, that has to be it. Just gonna look at editorial

---
# Post Mortem

Okay, I'm just retarded I guess, for some reason I **literally** made the observation that "hey, if we dynamically maintain the centroid, the answer is literally just adjacent to the centroid", but then just forgot all about it once I made it a rooted tree. **facepalm** jfc my associations between primitives just suck if I lose an observation simply because it switched from an unrooted tree to a rooted tree lmao.

Okay, with that observaiton, no crazy Interactive Mex Tree thing, you just like, do it, O(1) sz update with the push pull thing I was talking about

Very nice problem, a little goofy ahh at the end there, but overall good :thumbs_up: 

---
# E

For every pair of cities, is there a union of at most two paths in the input set that results in a superset. 

Don't know if this helps, but clearly only pairs of leaves matter. 

Okay, this implies that only bus routes s.t. one end is a leaf matters. 

An example of something that would work is a star graph with long legs, every bus stop touches the center, and one stems from each leaf. 

---

Okay to handle buses that span leaf to leaf, we'll just give both leaves that lane, doesnt matter.

Now what we're asking is: For any pair of leaves, can we find and common node between their sets of buses that stem from them. 

---

This can clearly only happen iff both bus roots go through the LCA. [strange how rooting a tree suddenly makes this so obvious... nice paradigm]

^^^ also the above is complete bullshit. ONE of the buses must go through the lca, but they can still intersect lower, loll

Okay, how about we focus leaf by leaf; fix one leaf, we know how it "branches out". 

There are O(m) critical points; all every single other bus has to do is get above ANY of the critical points.

---
So now every single other bus has just one critical point they really want; leave it up somewhere. 

There are leaves of these points (don't need to modify, just include self and A OK)

Your goal is to now query the set of points that are an ancestor to your bus. 

---
- Hold the brakes for a second.
- When my QUERY NODE goes to the LCA and then down, yes this is ture.
- If my query node's bus stop goes LESS than the LCA, it's possible that someone else comes down to grace me with a connection. 

This seems hard to fix. 

If it were always the case or the other, then maybe some double counting scheme would work, but then how do you count when both go precisely to the LCA, or maybe even both go way over or something. 

Well, let's analyze the paths themselves.

When you go down from an LCA to x, any node that comes from the subtree of X, up, is good now. 

Ugh idk this shits hard 

---

This seems like such a bashable problem, so I want to just keep on continuing, but at the same time, it feels... "bash", so I'm not too inclined to think too hard about it. 

I think I'll just read the editorial, there are plenty of problems out there to catch up on, and I want to round this out. **I've never read the entirety of a Div1 editorial lmao** because it's "cheating" and "I might enjoy it later". Bruh, it's one Div1, chill out, just read. 

---
# Post Mortem

Whoa. Okay, the solution was genuinely nice, wow. 

Wait, this is such a nick observation. Like, it seems so simple in hindsight, but like, this is something he'd 100% get. 

Can't tell if my brain is just fried or what. It seems super obvious in hindsight, and once you have that there's probably so many ways to bash it out. 

Wait, **I'm actually so retarded.** That's such an obviously true condition, you just intersect the induced graphs and you're done, proof. WTF? 

Yeah okay, this is definitely a case of **terrible dfsing**. Horrible habit of going deep deep for the first thing I see. Ugh. LCA casework bash lmao. 

I mean, that kind of bash seems intuitive to me and promising, but evidently that's not the solution. 

You **can** make observations. We literally made the induced subgraph observation. We just for some reason decided to go data structure monkey mode instead of like, actual thinking mode. 

This isn't even thinking issue, this is just like, horrible meta-decision making issue. I guess I'm really not used to proving like existence properties about stuff, despite it being such a common CF trope to do this kind of clever reduction.

[Maybe I should just try to sit with some object and analyze every possible mathematical thing I can do with it, and then try interesting algorithmic things on it, as an exercise to reframe my thinking?]

---
# F 

Okay, not even going to bother making observations, just going to see what the flavor of a Div1F is like. 

Again, there's plenty of hard atcoder and cf and oi problems out there, we just never look at them. Let's just take a peek :)

---
# Post Mortem

Okay, make some crazy observation, then make some crazy data structure observation. Makes sense. 

Didn't really even take a peek but now I know the general gist. 

I didn't even understand this editorial but I feel like it's similar to that one ARC problem we did on the flgiht to WF with nick in the newark airport. The one where they did some insane process.
