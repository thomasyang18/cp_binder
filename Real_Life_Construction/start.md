I have a vision involving connect the dots. A wood circle, with multicolored pegs, rubber bands to represent connections. 

This gives away a lot of the intuition that comes with the problem, sure, but it's physical and seems like a very fun project. 

(Please don't try and emulate this with pincushions. I just had a very vivid vision involving flying pincushions due to rubber band tension. It probably won't happen, but... it's dangerous :P )

This? This goes in the **unmonetizable** category. Both on a moral level and a logical level. 

It's a neat party trick to show others to get them excited about a cute problem, or get them into math. It can't be shown twice to the same person, so eventually the market will get saturated pretty quickly, especially if your goal is to "go viral" with this. Competition will be fierce. 

I guess that might be a good thing, if a bunch of competitive programmers get employed to become visual puzzle makers at these companies? Speaking of that, there's the moral angle. Think about all the enviornmental waste too that will go into a product like this...

Basically, when an individual does it, it's quirky, when company does it, soul sucking and bad. 

Maybe whenever a niche thing gets too big, it always turns bad, because the majority of people are just bad at it. Including me, for example. Why would I be more qualified than any other random CF master to do this. 

And the answer is that it's better when your eccentric friends find cool problems and make it themselves, instead of buying it from some corpo - which again, requires that this doesn't become some kind of enterprise. 

So, yup. Found a cool thing I could actually do with competitive programming puzzles. That's neat. 

**I suppose that is evidence that doing all this blogging is useful somewhat**. I'm not a creative guy, I need to brute force to find ideas lmao. 

In 20 years when we all have virtual reality and coding is super trivial and easy and robots are smarter than humans, there won't be a purpose to these things, but whatever man.
