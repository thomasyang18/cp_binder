# MO Math

I dunno, I kind of have a bias against it. Maybe my lack of expertise? But like, I think algorithms are cooler since they're, in general, more gneeral. Of course, you can have general MO problems (and a lot of MO problems can be algorithms, obv cuz CS \subseteq math) but like some of them can get to just "algebra bash" territory, which again, may or may not be creative but u just like algebra it. IDK. 

I look at [Harvard-MIT 2020 Algebra/Number Theory 7, Andrew Gu.](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2202h2087484_a_barrage_of_problems_from_the_past_few_months), and like, yes, it's pretty clever, uses a math identity, has some casework, but at the end of the day it's like.... okay? 

I mean, sure, you can take away some obvious things - casework, wilson's theorem, algebra bash, etc. for future problems but damn am I not that inspired. Perhaps it's my lack of ability to appreciate some core part of this problem that makes me unable to appreciate it on a deeper level. But idk. Move some shit, build some shit, idk. 

Like, a lot of these MO problems really remind me of why I picked up CP in the first place; there's just those occasional gems of problems. And a decent amount of more combinatorial / game theory MO problems are like this as well. Anton-era people were spoiled, I guess. 

- pro tip: to make a competitive programmer like you, frame the problem as an algorithm, a game, or a constructive problem. 

Heuristical computer science brings it back down. I mean, I guess all data structures are some heuristic (usaully log(n) data structures for divide and conquer) that just have some "trivial" bound you can prove, so at the end of the day it's like, fine, your model is better than mine because it uses less resources on some axis, gg. (but I do hate it when its unprovable ig?)

If I'm complaining about the act of modeling, then like wtf, basically everything is fucked.

As for IPhO, wow, first of all, fucking pages upon pages of derivatives, terrifying. But I guess this is "just" modeling - for example, in physics class in high school, we'd assume that the trajectory of a rocket would follow a parabola (actually, I think it would directly state that), and you had to make some assumptions based on that. 

Here, from my understanding of skimming some of the IPhO 2024 problems, the idea is that hey, you don't know what the hell the system is, you have to make plenty of assumptions about how you want to go about modeling this weird phenomenon, about what's relevant and what's not. And, being an olympiad, I assume the observations needed to get to a correct model require clever insight and assumptions (though again it was mostly a skim; the skimmed parts that I did understand seemed to be like that though). 

TBF I did see some of the arguments (such as "ehh Y element doesn't really matter, assume it to be 0") show up in my AP Physics class I think, but obviously other arguments I didn't understand.

In that sense, it's actually pretty similar to MO and CP. On the other hand... idk, maybe I just like slightly more abstract things than trying to model a system (although this kind of shit is what will actually get you paid, and probably more useful in real life.)
