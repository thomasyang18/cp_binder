Uhh, yeah. So this review is going to be a half braindead review from tired upsolving. I think I want to not take these type of notes anymore (especially for Div2's), but I'll just have another one of these just for the feeling.

I've yet to document a true post-contest review, so I suppose tommorow's the time for that. 

# Review

A - okay

B - okay 

C - cute, but greedy immidiately shows to separate 0 1 2 etc. 

D - yeah, lowkey just guessed this without proof. 

E - Very cute problem, very neat that it ends up being a graph problem, trolled on impl so hard.

F - Standard dfs tree task, though I guess dfs trees weren't standard back then. 

-----------

Overall, more of a feelsgood AK. This was a cute set, I'd definitely reccomend this set to a beginner, the problems were all good to think about. They were all "standard" though so like idk. 

[dbaumg's tool](https://dbaumg.github.io/cf-tools/) is pretty feelsgood :D

# Takeaway

As I said before, this was an unusually good div2 I feel. Modern div2's definitely are skill inflated compared to before (like E and F are not modern red difficulty), so they can be intimidating. While edurounds, while they do have their place in being educational, often just have some complete garbage hogwash problems, that sure "teach you" stuff but aren't very inspiring or fun. This was a very nice beginner contest.

Ah. This was in the era of anton problemsetting. That's probably why the contest was so good. 

I'm all for data structure tasks, and again, I think people overrate {insert not data structure problem here} (they'll call generating function or linear algebra problems "good" just because it's "mathy" :skull:), but Anton problems are just like, good.
