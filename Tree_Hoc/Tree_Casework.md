# Tree Casework

I hate casework as much as the next guy, but tree casework is honestly pretty fun. Casework often just result in "DFS down a bunch of different branches until all cases are exhausted" which is, well, exhausting. Trees are also one of the nicest kind of object you can draw on paper. You can always embed a tree on a plane, unlike a graph. Plus, although there are some **very** cool tree problems and techniques, a lot of the time it's some DP/data structure pure garbage. A common joke in the CP community is that if you want to make a problem hard, just solve it on an array, then set it on a tree. And within programming contest restraints, it's still acceptable. 

There's also another class of problems that are more like, general principles on trees but still very ad hoc? Like for example [this assignment problem](https://contest.ucup.ac/contest/1714/problem/8840) and [this problem](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1237) which are both very cool in their own right, but they're more describing a sort of process rather than casework. 

Let me just show you; I'll try to encompass the theory behind each problem in just a simple picture.

## Takeaway

It's sort of hard to make a nice problem discussing processes on
