# Groupsolving in CP 

Date: 12-10-2024

Maybe programmers are just more solitary creatures than math people, or maybe I'm just a more solitary person, but I've never really felt good about groupsolving. 

Why? Well, there's like two experiences I can try typing out here: 

## Left in the dust

Your friend, the genius big brain cper, just 1 shots the problem. 

## Go fast together 

Multiple people competing for the same observation is like, bruhs. Also this leads to very sloppy thinking - I definitely notice that when we work together on a problem, it's "easy to mindsolve". In math (esp oly math) sure, the impl details are often not the trouble, but in competitive programming, the impl details are precisely the trouble. 

That's why our team often has someone sit in a corner and try formalizing the approach **for themselves**. I just don't think pair programming is really that effective. Idk, maybe joe + akif dynamic says otherwise, but like, here's my impression:

**Guy 1**: Has a model of the problem, including how he wants to impl, and starts typing.

**Guy 2**: Only can guess at wtf is going on in guy 1's brain, sure some high level details work but maybe low level details get lost. 

I guess that may be the only way of collaboration, though, since the alternative is let guy 1 write it all out and do code review, which is basically the same thing but "offline". 

## Slow down? 

Well... if I don't get something my friend says, then it's like, I'm just retarded bro. Sometimes my brain's too fried, or I'm on my own train of thought, like, idk. 

(Well, one could argue that if I'm not willing to listen to my friend on their solution to a problem, A. Why would I listen to them about something else, and B. bruh kills all collaboration? )

And so what does this leave us to "talk about CP" with? I suppose you could bring up cool techniques you learned. 

Or you can just tell them a problem and tell them to marinate on it (this works long term, I think, I think this kind of problem solving builds long-term comraderie. But obviously **in the moment**, it's like, wtf, I want to do something together I guess.)

Usually I just end up shooting the shit though and just not talking about CP.

I mean let's put it this way. I would not talk about programming all the time with my programming friends, either. (nor math etc.)

IDK. Surely there's something interesting.
