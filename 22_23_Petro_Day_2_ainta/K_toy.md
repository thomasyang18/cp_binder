# Making a Toy for problem K 

Date: 12-2-2024

There's three levels to abstraction you can go to this. 

1. How do I solve this puzzle for a specific case? It's simple enough on small cases for you to just try doing it. 

2. How do I solve this puzzle in the general case? Unlike a rubik's cube, you can answer 1 without 2 here, which makes it so interesting that there's an easily understandable solution of the form of 2. 

3. How do I generalize the solution to this puzzle? Higher dimensions, maybe? Add even more constraints and objects? I suppose this is the researcher's domain. Throw increasingly hard weaponry at it. 

I think you can make a toy for this. Have a circular board with multicolored, round pegs. The point of the toy is to loop rubber bands through differently colored pegs (if there's >= 3 colors, you can always do it in N - 3 loops). 

I thought this would be interesting, lol. I wonder if you can make it for cheap, ad hoc. 

Obviously you can draw it, but having it be physical will appeal to a lot more people, including me.
