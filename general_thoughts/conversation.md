# Competitive Programming conversation 

Date: 12-7-2024

Just celebrated Adam's birthday, happy birthday Adam! 

I'm constantly reminded of just how little I actually talk about competitive programming, I guess. 

First of all, the thing with hard individual things, is that, by definition, if they're hard, they must take somewhat long to think about. Not all of us are geniuses, and this is self adapting; you wouldn't give a standard 2500 problem to an LGM. 

And, I mean, I'm sorry, nobody when seriously thinking can show their entire thought process to someone else. It'd be really fucking cool if we could just transmit that between brains, but I'm not boutta try to study to become a neurosurgeon or something. Perhaps this is just a technology diff.

- again, a common theme in our lives, is that **not everything is just solved with higher education**. Please use our brains to try and think harder for a bit. This is equivalent to saying "ah this problem is standard, just code up some loglog B-tree augmented with range min updates range xor queries, see it's in this paper" or some shit. Or like, "software is useless because P vs NP or the Riemann Hypothesis will be solved one day and just make a huge breakthrough and destroy all of modern software". We get there when we get there, chill out.

I mean, the thing with CP problems is that it's all solved problems, and they're all essentially puzzles at the end of the day. The point is to struggle with them, think with them, toy with them.

The more context specific thing is, everybody that does CP eventually goes on to do better things with their time, often in deeper fields of math/CS. Or they just go into SWE. Point is, not many people stay in CP, for, well, CP. 

If you're a researcher, you might want to discuss high level research goals to someone, or if someone's more familiar in the field, the latest techniques or something I guess. 

Idk, I don't think there's much point in discussing a CP problem outside of just, stashing a cool, hard problem in the back of your mind. Like, the point is that it should take a while to think about, you don't want to just give the main observation away immidiately, that's the fun of the puzzle. 

So perhaps just every time you meet, it's like "here you go, new set of problems to think about, wanna discuss some problems from the last time we talked?" 

I mean, okay, sure, if you want to discuss convexity tricks and then show increasingly complex and convoluted math statements to prove it and map to flow or whatever, bring out a ton of machinery, that feels more acceptable I guess. But if I'm solving a problem like [this shit](https://codeforces.com/gym/102431/problem/I), how the fuck am I supposed to enjoy solving it when somebody tells me bro. It's like, a constructive problem, but that's sort of the point of CP - you don't want things to be one shottable with standard techniques. 

One **new** thing I'm thinking of is again, toys based on CP, but that novelty can wear off pretty quickly I think. Also it seems expensive to make good toys based on that. Plus, they're toys lmao. 

Idk, it seems like most CP conversation just goes to, either in-the moment problem solving, or what we're doing in courses or future career plans or whatever. Or we can go be collaborative and solve a problem together - idk, as a fun casual conversation starter that does not seem to go over well. When we're practicing on a set, sure, because we're all trying to work towards a common goal of AKing the set, if you kill off the super hard constructive problem, hey, more thinking time for me on my favorite problems. As a conversation starter, I feel like it's ironically easier to have ego be involved. Like what kind of psychopath goes up to their friends and says, "Hey, I pulled this random 3000 problem from the internet, wanna think about it?" 

I mean, okay, there's definitely situations where that's acceptable. If you both have nothing to do for the next 3 hours and to yourselves, go for it, go wild. 

The issue is I guess for me, I want to understand the problem and appreciate it for myself, I guess? It is kind of an ego thing.

Actually, I remember talking with colin galen about some yukicoder slimes problem, and he brought up some "rebuilding some recursive tree of subproblems" type deal, and lowkey I was just unable to follow the conversation but it seemed like some other people were able to. 

So maybe that's just a skill issue - people in general don't have an issue discussing these techniques and such, I just have a skill issue I guess.

---

Like, even aside from conversation, I don't understand for example, why I wouldn't find things like the inverse ackermann function (proof of DSU), graph spanners, or mincut/maxflow interesting, whereas for example, I would like a lot of these simpler cf problems. 

## Hypothesis 1: These things (usually theory) are hard, the other things are not. 

I mean... this is true I guess.

## Hypothesis 2: CF Problems have the incentive of "oh I'll do well, get a green AC" 

Well, I mean... sure, but the theory itself is arguably smarter and more elegant, having been refined by millions of people, so idk. 

## Hypothesis 3: CF/MO Problems are picked for elegance/simplicity 

This seems pretty reasonable; real life useful tools are often complicated and hard.

I dunno, I just don't think the answer, for me, is "just study more math/cs" even if that's where all the paths are pointing to. 

"Maybe it will bring better problem ideas" yeah idk buddy.
