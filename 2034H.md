# CF 2034 H (failed)

Date: 12-7-2024

This is in the same category as bureka and queries; I thought I could cheese, but guess not. Disgusting number theory casework bash seems to be one of the topics on CF of all time. 

At least projecteuler style problems (recall the classic shash 10^11 sieve problems) are like, pure mathy.

Dumb fucking problem, I looked at the time complexity of the editorial and it's like wtf??? Also the editorial is so dense, I'm not going to bother reading it. I'll just try to explain how I approached the problem. I didn't end up solving it, and I'm not parsing the editorial, so I have no idea if this approach is on the right track, but oh well. 

## Approach

Pretty obvious it's GCD. Think in terms of the GCD lattice (for once, this interpretation is actually kinda helpful?)

If you have two different sets of nodes in the lattice A and B, if they share the same **meet**, you can find a counterexample that breaks the condition. (take setdifference)

Okay, so what this means is that the set of all possible gcd(S) for S \in powerset (exclude empty) must be distinct. 

## Unproven bullshit part 

So how does this look in the powerset lattice (multiplicty doesn't matter here). 

I wrote a brute force, it appears that 

011xxxx
101xxxx
110xxxx

this pattern must be present for some set of N axes, if there are N things in your set. Proof? Idk, you can probably show it with induction, I'm genuinely stupid and can't prove it even with a bit of thinking, so let's take this as is. 

## Even more unproven bullshit part 

So what does this mean when multiplicty matters (bitwise AND = min)? 

Well, each column now has a min element, and non-min elements. Non-min elements don't matter, only min elements matter, if we say the bitwise AND interpretation and conversion is true. 

This means that basically, we have some "lower bound mask" we can iterate over; for example if our focused columns look like 

0222
1123
1204
1411

this would be valid, because there is exactly 1 min per column and row. (it obviously works when you replace all the non-mins with ones, so having various other non-min elements can only add more variety).

where the lower bound mask looks like 

0101

and you'll be iterating over tuples like 

(exactly 0, >= 2, >= 1, >= 2)
(>= 1, exactly 1, >= 1, >= 2)

etc.

## Crucial mistake

My crucial mistake is not realizing that the number of masks I need to consider is **not** O(MAXAI), because notice that I can go at least 1 prime factor above, so it's something like O(MAXAI^2). 

Well, I think it's bounded by O(MAXAI^1.5) because <= 2 case is trivial, so you need at least 3 cyclic builds... at the same time, like bruhmongus. 

After peeking at editorial time complexity and having trauma from bureka and queries, no thank you. 

## Takeaway

I really tried the lattice approach to numbers. I really did. It's probably my favorite way of thinking about them (maybe I should learn more mathematical objects lmao, I only picked that up from a grad compilers course). I cheesed Burenka and queries with that. 

And I came away with some pretty cool results. I think. It passed 3 testcases once I upped the TL to 30s; OTOH, they're probably all trivial small ones. Sooo... :shrug: 

But alas, thinking about number theory by actually thinking about them as numbers... is superior.
