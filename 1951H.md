AAAAAAA

## Initial Approach

Think binary search first, and treat the game as, "Alice wants to get at least 1 black cell into every bucket of size (2^(k - t))". 

I recall when first trying this problem, I tried some top down stuff and didn't really get anywhere with the analyses. I tried bounding by obvious things such as # of black values satisfied, and # of free black values, but nothing worked. It's very tricky, it depends on the structure of the recursion and decisions which makes it hard. I think. 

## Recent Approach

When re-attempting this problem, I remembered the above failures (not the specifics, just "do not try top down."). So I tried bottom up. And I thought I found a really, really clean formulation. 

Basically, you have this binary tree like data structure. You still want to get 1 black cell into every node. When sweeping from high to low value, placing a node at the corresponding leaf value (the binary tree shrinks with less rounds played, so multiple values can map to 1 leaf), it's like:

- Color the leaf black.
- If the leaf is black, go to the highest non-black node above the leaf.
- Match with any node in the subtree, if any. 

In step 2, you need to be careful to not exceed depth flow upwards; however, downwards flow doesn't really matter.

You can greedily match things because of an exchange argument, if you look at the set of flows. Actually, it's pretty much exactly a flow graph lol. 

```cpp
G(k) 
vl pos((1 << k));
F(i, 0, pos.size()) {
    G(x) pos[x - 1] = i;
}
vl ans;
F(L, 1, k + 1) {
    vl up_flow((1<<L + 1)), sz((1<<L + 1));
    F(i, sz.size() / 2, sz.size()) sz[i] = 1;
    FD(i, sz.size() / 2 - 1, 0) sz[i] = sz[i * 2] + sz[i * 2 + 1];
    F(i, 2, up_flow.size()) up_flow[i] = up_flow[i/2] + 1;

    FD(i, (1<<k) - 1, -1) {
        ll cur = (pos[i] >> (k - L)) + sz.size() / 2;

        while (1) {
            if (sz[cur]) {
                sz[cur]--; // go down to arbitrary leaf node to match , exchange argument
                ll tcur = cur;
                while (tcur > 1) tcur /= 2, sz[tcur]--;
                while (cur * 2 < sz.size()) {
                    if (sz[cur * 2]) cur = cur * 2;
                    else cur = cur * 2 + 1;
                    sz[cur]--;
                }
                break;
            }
            else if (!up_flow[cur]) break;
            else --up_flow[cur], cur /= 2;
        }

        if (!sz[1]) {
            ans.push_back(i + 1);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

This approach seems **so clean**! but alas it's wrong. 

Consider the following test case:

```
4
12 15 16 13 6 4 7 2 14 9 11 10 8 1 3 5
```

for when the buckets are of size 2. 

You end up with the base leaf layer of 

```
2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0
```

and while it seems you can just do the mapping internally, you actually can't, because right under the root, the flow capacities look like 

```
2 0 2 0
```

and you don't have enough moves to actually satisfy both 2 0 2 0 flows. 

Well, this formulation does make it slightly easier to reason about it, I think, because instead of thinking about swaps, you can give a construction and just check it against each layer's checking formula. At the same time, I don't know what those formulas per layer are. 

I really hope this idea is at least on the right track ðŸ˜”. It felt hard to me to get the details precisely right (also there's no way I was able to prove it lol, thankfully found a counterexample)

Admittedly, this is one of those ideas that I'm like, "this sounds hella cool, let's try this idea". I've basically only explored two ideas for this problem so far. If I want to solve harder problems, I have to be able to explore hard ideas quicker I guess. 

But my brain is fried after trying to get this to work for a while, soo.... an addendum will come if I get inspiration to fix this later.
