## Approach Day 1

So obviously you can get this in 3n moves. 

I imagined the solution to n moves would be to write down all the delta equations at each step for the straights. This almost works immidiately, the issue is, 0 is not invertible, so it can screw you over. 

This yields a solution in 2n moves. 

## Approach Day 2 

Finally made the observation that, if you query a tile once, you know whether or not it's initially [0, 1] or >= 2; furthermore, if it's >= 2, you know exactly the number. 

(This further extends to, if you query the same tile twice, you will always know exactly what the initial count is, though I didn't make that connection till later). 

Using this observation, I started treating the problem as, "we have some indices that are [0, 1], and we want to find a solution. How can we do that?" 

I tried sat, flow, etc. until I settled on just a simple bitmask DP, since only ~5 numbers in the equation actually matter.

I typed it up correctly. The fucking issue? The algorithm is not correct, it can have ambiguous solutions, especially since the algorithm involves brute forcing over the first 4 elements to fix them. 

If we had n+2 queries, this would be no issue...

I mean, so many signs point to this (this weird ad hoc bitmask DP is not going to be the solution, its too messy, it's sus, should've been easy to write some small cases first **before** typing up sus, etc.) that like, yeah, this falls under "Thomas Yang once again typing up bullshit to cheese a problem instead of thinking about it legit" 

Also, now I have no confidence that n+2 queries would even yield a unique solution anymore. Soo....

In general, I **may** be too retarded? Like I resort to thinking about insane formulations instead of attacking from first principles. Hm. But first principles is hard bruh. 

## Approach Day 3 

Let brute forcer run for n+2 queries... it's working, but it's also hella sus.

I tried seeing, hey, maybe it's a balancing problem, so we do 2 queries on the first index, get info for n-1 queries total... nope. 

Although it does seem like n+1 queries is possible.... argh!!!!!

There's actually just 0 salvaging the approach rip. Need a huge new observation I think

FUCK THIS MEANS I NEED TO THINK OF AN ADAPTIVE STRATEGY AHHHHHHHHH THAT FEELS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM
