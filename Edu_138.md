# CF Educational Round 138 

Date: 11-29-2024

I'm really finding low effort content, huh.

---

A - didn't read 

B - I guess this is educational because it's trying to teach you to iteratively simplify (a's don't matter, it's best to go greedy from sides, analyze what the final contribution of b's will look like minimally)

C - This is just... implement the problem statement. Don't even have to binary search. As long as you correctly realize that based on how the process is going, "+k - i + 1" is equivalent to "delete the number" for Alice. 

D - Common with counting setups in competitive programming IG. First notice that it's always possibly by picking 1 over and over, then when you try to reason about what's not possible, then it becomes obvious. 

E - Classic problem. I think it's pretty clever to realize that the optimal cactus wall must be that checkerboard pattern (intuitively, if it were not, then there would be some gap in the optimal wall ), can be tricky to realize that the cactus wall can go backwards. 

F - Uhh, this is just skill issue. You obviously have to do something with the distances, I just... couldn't. Didn't really bother parsing editorial. It's probably pretty nice, but I can understand why people will go to my problem M and say "ew" now, I guess lol. 

For data structures, it's a fine line between caseworky "just do it" garbage and a truly clever perspective. Can't comment on this because I haven't parsed the editorial.

I tried to use a similar technique as to [this problem](https://codeforces.com/gym/105284/problem/G), where you want to analyze some path intersection stuff by doing things with the LCA of the paths and such. I feel like that idea to handle paths is pretty common (also showed up in Amoebas in OCPC).

## Moral of the story? 

Well, I mainly made this note because this was staring at me for a few days after I was reminded of this contest. 

There's obviously value in trying to think about problems beyond just solving them. For ABC.... yeah, I tried to justify it a little, but they're not really much to them. 

D... I mean, random ass counting setups are so prevalent in CP, often 1 shot by a few observations, so perhaps it's useful to group them together.

Seriosuly, can we talk about "junk problems" in CP?

E definitely has value, it's pretty similar to thinking about a "mincut" in a sense? Except here you know the structure of the mincut must be a connected diagonal path. 

and F is something I should just learn. 

The thing is, I guess, that this kind of more lax reflecting and reviewing, I think to most people, is probably more fun (and ultimately more productive)?
