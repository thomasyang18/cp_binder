I think there's definitely a distinct flavor of competitive programming problems I simply love. Competitive programming problems are contrived puzzles after all. 

In research, these are generally your avenues:
    - You yak shave for slight speedups (I get scared seeing loglog/logloglog time complexities)
    - You are looking for a general solution ("specific solutions" most of the time, from what I understand, are frowned upon). Of course, special problems can help with understanding, but they're by no means the end goal. 
    - Years trying at a specific problem + theory, so you're generally inventing more and more complicated things 
    - There's prestiege in research, so many, many more (intelligent) people are doing it

In industry, generally:
    - You just have a bunch of data requirements, often imposed
    - Being smart <<<< being safe. Especially as productions get larger and larger and the nature of how people switch out of jobs
    - Tons of domain specific context, I'd argue even moreso than math/CS research? Like math at the end of the day, if you study enough, I feel is pretty transferrable (between math), whereas "what does line 267 do and why is there a comment saying not to remove this line" is not a transferrable skill but can be super important to know lol. 

Yes some of these avenues contradict in each section other on the surface level, but if you get it you get it.


Competitive programming data structure problems can often be pretty bad; some problems are effectively "implement this well known data structure". Some are super creative though; for example, plenty of DSU problems have pretty novel and creative ways to go about them. 

Also there's definitely an incentive to think very abstractly and carefully at a global scale for single threaded logic when doing cp idk 



Especially when the we're only working with numbers (integers, doubles, etc.) there are tons of nice math properties that you can exploit. Many compiler optimizations for example are based off of this. 

But how the hell are you going to reason cleverly about Jim's credit card information and bank account. There's just no need to. 

At the same time, research moves on to try and tackle these more abstract things. 

idk man.
