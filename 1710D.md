This seems like the type of problem where, to solidify your intuition and such, it's definitely good to look at other people's solutions and try and think of variations to this.

Hold the phone, randomly solved a 3400 LMAO. Little bit of a victory lap. 

If I want to extract maximum value from this problem, I probably need to write a decent reflection for how I thought about this, and compare it to other people's solutions, because lowkey I have no idea how to prove it. 

## Approach

So first notice that if [x, x+1] then that edge exists.

Then if [x, x + 2], one of [x, x + 1] or [x + 1, x + 2] exists. 

etc. so my first thought was to try and pigeonhole when does a node exist. 

After trying several tree examples (maybe like 5 of them), I came to the conclusion that it's "probably best" that on an interval [x, y], we connect (x, y), and then connect everything in between.

This failed, and rather than use more brainpower I just coded up a brute force and quickly found that yeah no this doesn't work because for example if the range looks like 

```
(x) (a) (b) (c) (y)
```

then (x, a) should not be an edge that is taken. 

<details>
<spoiler>dumb detour</spoiler>

Okay, then I said, never let (x, x + 1) be connected. This should've been instead, "never let x, and the component after x, be directly connected".

Wasted an hour on that. After I figured out the bug with that...
</details>



Then I reasoned that nothing else mattered. Submit!!!! 

I mean, I feel like it's "not hard" to prove. Like inherently, if you ahve the nubmers 

```
a < b < c < d 
```

the best way to split them up to force them to connect only if they're a full interval is 

c - a - d - b 

lol. And nothing else in the middle matters since it's bounded by those four (you can just attach the garbage to a or d), though editorial went ham with the alternating construction, which makes sense. And this generalizes to intervals since well they're connected collections of numbers, but the inequality applies to the whole batch. 

At the same time, I have no idea how to really formally prove that this works, that's just my intuition lol. 

## Other people's approaches

[To be done here... probably a good thing to intrinsically do but I'll get to it when I feel like getting to it.]
