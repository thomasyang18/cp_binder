## Problem Statement

Given a weighted tree in which you don't know the weights of each edge, and you're only told, for every 1 <= i <= n-1, dist(i, i + 1). 

Recover the original edge weights of each edge, or determine there doesn't exist a solution. 

## Approach

Well, this seems like a linear algebra problem, since you have a bunch of unknowns (edge weights) but you know the combination of them. 

We can dig a bit deeper though. A very classic trick with trees is that 

```
dist(x, y) = dist(root, x) + dist(root, y) - 2 * dist(root, LCA(x, y)) in a rooted tree. 
```

I'm not sure exactly why this formulation is so useful. It looks like a prefix sum, you can sort of think about the tree top-down, all the variables now are structured and related nicely, etc? 

The most naive version of this is, oh, I have a query(l, r), but it turns out because this query is invertible, I can do query(r) - query( l- 1). 

Need to think more on this. [please don't publish until you've thought this through.]

From here, it's still not obvious how to approach the problem. But there's one simple trick!

Lol. From there, the idea becomes obvious. Apparently it's something called hensel lifting.

Very cool trick to solve these systems of equations. Not much else to say here. If I wanted to learn more then I could, but I don't think there's many takeaways from this problem besides literally the technique used. Which, again, it's a **really** cool technique, but shame that I feel like there's not many lessons to take away.
