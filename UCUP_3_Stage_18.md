A: Yeah, this we trolled on. I didn't even try considering that the algorithm was wrong until I just did more examples on paper. This is me being a bit stubborn, I think. The first thing I tried naturally was going up from the bottom, and so did Matt, and so did fucking Nick lmao.... plus 10^6 constraint bait. Yeah, this is a really good troll problem. Not really sure how to dig yourself out besides just be better for this one. 

C: This was absolute garbage. We made good observations, we just decided to throw it all away in favor of randomized cheese that was never going to work. And we weren't even that far off from the actual solution too once you made those basic observations lol. We were at this for **two hours**, and we had one of the crucial observations within like 5 minutes of thinking about the task. 

D: Didn't read. 

G: Didn't read. 

H: This seemed like a legit guess, the algorithm seemed nice enough in my head lol. I think proving it overall is the higher EV play, but submitting a reasonable guess in the middle of the contest might be a good desparation play? Though we argued that for L too... lol. 

J: This went okay, easy problem. 

K: Impl was okay, obviously a bit rusty but I worked out indices decently well and when I failed I debugged pretty well, I think. 

L: I looked at it and didn't have any ideas. Nick and Matt had some ideas but then got locally stuck. Matt said there was some bound on N that you could easily get by just swapping everything with 1, and yeah, that probably was the intended way to get to the intended solution. 

Also, Matt spent what looks like 30 minutes or so typing up a sus solution to this in contest. I mean this easily could've been me on H lmao, and was definitely us on C (horrible example set), but yeah, you really don't want to have a solution that both isn't proven and is hard to type. 

(Though this can result in complete braindeadness too... quickly iterating through randomized garbage on C)

Also, I offered to type treap to an ultimately wrong solution, thank god enough fucking red flags went off for me to not do that ultimately. At the same time, there should've been so many red flags for me to not type treap (insane, possibly wrong algo, 11 minute solve) that it's kind of embarassing that I even thought about that in the first place. 

I think again, symptom of getting too excited I guess.

I'm not really sure how to solve it, I guess when you get too caught up in emotions to think logically through stuff, or when you just want a problem to be easily solved so you guess some stupid bullshit, etc. 

I think having the mindset that hey, most of these problems are really not hard to solve; like the clincher problems for a lot of sets will just not be rated above GM difficulty most of the time. It's not that the answer is trivial so you should get it, it's more like the answer is not some insane shit so don't sweat it. 

Which kind of sucks, but yeah, that's what you're training for when you're doing 5 hours instead of thinking about problems. You're training to solve a prefix of the set that you can train on fast and well, so that you can get not only a good score, but time to think about a suffix of the set in which you actually will need to sit down and buckle up I guess. 

And unless you're LGM you're probaby not going to solve the problem that <10% of people solved, so don't ego it in practice nor in contest. Remember what you're practicing for - placements in official contests. Not necessarily solving cool problems. 

(Well, now that I'm out of the ICPC loop, I can do whatever I want :D)
